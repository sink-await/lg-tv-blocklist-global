# FAQ

Answers to the questions that come up most often. See the [README](../README.md) for install instructions and tier descriptions, and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#format-semantics) for format semantics.

## Which tier should I use?

- **SAFE** — blocks ads, ACR, and telemetry while keeping everything functional (Content Store, app updates, OTA, ThinQ, streaming apps). The right choice for almost everyone. No root required: these are DNS lists — they work in Pi-hole, AdGuard Home, NextDNS, and similar.
- **STRICT** — SAFE's entries plus firmware OTA, ThinQ cloud sync, and LG Channels kill rows, plus zone anchors (whole-subtree blocks) and weak/unknown observations. It assumes you want the TV to stop talking to LG, not just stop being tracked. The Content Store may degrade — see the carve-out below.

Root is only required for the `/etc/hosts` install path on the TV itself. DNS-level blocking never needs root.

## Will this break Netflix / Prime / HBO / YouTube?

No. SAFE's promise — verified on an LG G1 — is that these keep working while ads, ACR, and telemetry die. STRICT keeps streaming working too; what it breaks by design is firmware OTA updates, ThinQ cloud sync, and LG Channels. The functional risks in STRICT are the Content Store and LG account login (see the README breakage matrix); the carve-out below addresses the store.

Disney+ and other streaming apps were not part of the G1 smoke test: SAFE is expected to leave them working (they use their own infrastructure, none of which is on the list), but that is inference, not tested evidence.

## I want STRICT but keep the LG Content Store

STRICT blocks whole zones (`||lge.com^`, `||lgeapi.com^`, `||nextlgsdp.com^`, ...) because store, update, telemetry, and account services all live inside those trees. To keep the store, carve out exceptions for the specific hosts it needs.

**The trap to avoid:** do NOT use umbrella exceptions like `@@||lge.com^`. That unblocks every `*.lge.com` host — including the firmware-OTA family (`snu`, `su`, `su-ssl`, `ngfts`, `gfts`) that STRICT exists to block. And in AdGuard, `$important` on an exception beats `$important` on a block (priority: important exception > important block > normal exception > normal block), so umbrella `$important` exceptions silently kill your own blocking rules. Our lists use no `$important`, so a plain `@@` exception is enough — only add `$important` if you are fighting another list's important blocks.

**Starting point (community-testing — not yet G1-verified; trim it with your own query log):**

```text
# SDP/store comms — needed with the adblock lists (our ||lgtvsdp.com^ covers de./us.); domains/hosts users can drop it.
# Keep the group matching your TV's region; delete the other.
@@||de.lgtvsdp.com^
@@||de.lgeapi.com^
@@||de.ibs.nextlgsdp.com^
# US TVs:
@@||us.lgtvsdp.com^
@@||us.lgeapi.com^
@@||us.ibs.nextlgsdp.com^
@@||a.lgappstv.com^
# Add only if your query log shows the store hitting them:
# @@||qt2-ngp-gl-prv-front.lge.com^
# @@||alkas.lge.com^
# @@||aic-updr.lge.com^
# @@||snsu.lge.com^
# @@||service.lgtvcommon.com^
# Thumbnails: whitelist the EXACT lgappstv.com host from your log — never the
# lgappstv.com umbrella (it also carries ad.lgappstv.com, an ad host):
# @@||<exact-host>.lgappstv.com^
# Unblock only if the TV shows offline / "no internet" UI quirks:
# @@||lgtvonline.lge.com^
```

**Region prefixes:** the `de.` hosts above are what the German G1 audit saw; the `us.` set is its US sibling. All 49 shipped codes are blocked, so swap the prefix for your own (`fr.`, `br.`, `gb.` — LG uses `gb`, not `uk`) and confirm the exact hostnames against your query log. The blocked zones themselves are region-agnostic in the adblock lists (`||lgeapi.com^` also covers `fr.lgeapi.com`), so only the exceptions need adjusting.

Confidence varies — that is why this is a starting point, not gospel. STRICT annotates `de.lgeapi.com` as *store/billing interplay unproven* and `de.ibs.nextlgsdp.com` as *store risk* (both are caught by their zone anchors), and `a.lgappstv.com` as *app-update function unproven*. External sources fill the rest: `lgeapi.com` is the region App Store backend (public reverse-engineering, e.g. webos-unclutter); `lgtvsdp.com` is LG's Service Delivery Platform ("responsible for Content Store communication among others" — webosbrew wiki) — our SAFE tier blocks its apex, so with the adblock lists `||lgtvsdp.com^` covers `de.lgtvsdp.com` and this exception is needed for store comms; with domains/hosts lists (exact-name) it is unnecessary; `nextlgsdp.com` may carry in-app billing; `lgappstv.com` is the store CDN apex.

**Keep these blocked** even if the store keeps working: the `snu`/`su`/`su-ssl`/`ngfts`/`gfts` firmware-OTA and file-transfer family (not required for store function — if store thumbnails ever break, whitelist only the exact host from your log), `lss.lgthinq.com`, `bss.lgechannel.com`, plus the ad/telemetry hosts that STRICT already includes from SAFE: `cdpbeacon.lgtvcommon.com` (ACR beacon, ~6-minute heartbeat), `ads.lgtvcommon.com`, and the `homeprv`/`recommend`/`eic.nudge`/`eic.wiseconfig` family.

**How to verify on your network (AdGuard Home):**

1. Add the exceptions above as custom filtering rules (Filters → Custom filtering rules).
2. Query log → filter by the TV's IP → clear.
3. On the TV: open the store, browse, install a new app, update an app, reboot.
4. Look for blocked entries under `lge.com` / `lgeapi.com` / `nextlgsdp.com` / `lgappstv.com` / `lgtvsdp.com` / `lgtvcommon.com` that coincide with something failing — whitelist only those exact hosts.
5. Let it run for a day and confirm `cdpbeacon.lgtvcommon.com` stays blocked and the store still works.
6. Report your final set via the issue tracker — verified sets get folded into this recipe with credit.

## Why doesn't SAFE block all of lge.com instead of individual hosts?

Because `lge.com` is an umbrella zone: blocking it kills the Content Store, firmware updates, and account login along with the telemetry. SAFE only blocks hosts with observed ad/telemetry behavior (exact-name semantics). Whole-zone blocking is the STRICT philosophy — stronger, with documented collateral damage.

## My TV ignores my Pi-hole / AdGuard. Why?

webOS TVs ship with a local stub resolver and hardcoded fallback DNS (`8.8.8.8` / `1.1.1.1`), so they can bypass your LAN DNS. Packet captures on our G1 confirmed the stub ignoring LAN DNS. Fix it at the router, not the TV: NAT-redirect outbound port 53 to your DNS server, and block outbound 853 (DNS-over-TLS) — optionally known DoH endpoints too. On a rooted TV (webosbrew), [`examples/webos-hooks/`](../examples/webos-hooks/) has a ready-made hook that applies the port-53 redirect and the 853 drop on-device. See the README's resolver caveats.

## Why does the DNS-egress hook use my gateway as `RESOLVER_IP`?

The hook cannot reliably discover the TV's configured DNS server, so it falls back to the default-route gateway:

- `/etc/resolv.conf` on webOS points at a localhost stub; `nmcli`, `systemd-resolve`, and `resolvectl` do not exist, and no documented webOS API was found that exposes the configured DNS servers.
- So the script runs `ip route | awk '/^default/{print $3; exit}'`, with a comment noting to hardcode `RESOLVER_IP` if init runs before the network is up.

That matters because if your router forwards DNS to your own resolver, queries still get answered — but they arrive via the router/gateway: per-device attribution is lost, and depending on the router's config they may bypass your resolver and its filtering entirely.

**Point it at your own resolver:** set `RESOLVER_IP` to your resolver's IP — hardcoded near the top of `02-block-dns-egress.sh` (most reliable, since the init environment may not pass environment variables) or as an environment variable:

```sh
RESOLVER_IP=192.168.178.53 sh /var/lib/webosbrew/init.d/02-block-dns-egress
```

**Already ran the hook this boot?** Changing `RESOLVER_IP` on a re-run does not replace the old rule — the hook only appends, so the stale DNAT rule stays first-match and keeps winning, while the success line still reports the new IP. Remove the old rules first with `sh rollback-dns-egress.sh` (pass `RESOLVER_IP=<old-resolver>` if they were not created with the current gateway), then re-run with your `RESOLVER_IP` — or hardcode it and reboot: the kernel rules are rebuilt empty at boot.

**Verify:** the hook logs the resolver it chose — look for the `dnat 53 -> <IP>` line in `/var/log/02-block-dns-egress.log` (fallback `/tmp/02-block-dns-egress.log`).

## Why aren't `in-addr.arpa` / LAN discovery queries blocked?

Because they never leave the LAN. Reverse lookups under `in-addr.arpa` are answered by your local resolver in milliseconds, and discovery protocols (SSDP, mDNS) are link-local multicast — adding them to a DNS blocklist would not stop a TV from enumerating the LAN, it would only break reverse name resolution for everything else using that resolver. Stopping the scan itself needs device- or network-level rules (firewall drops of discovery traffic on a rooted TV or at the router), and expect that to break discovery-dependent features like casting. If the concern is the cloud side of the feature, the STRICT entry `ueiwsp.com` (QuickSet Cloud) covers it.

## Do exceptions work with the hosts-format lists?

AdGuard Home evaluates `@@` exceptions at the engine level, but the official docs only guarantee modifier semantics (`$important`, `$badfilter`) for rule-style filters — modifiers do not work with `/etc/hosts`-style entries. Our lists use no modifiers, so a plain `@@` exception works; still, for AdGuard Home we recommend the `-adblock.txt` URL anyway, because only the adblock format gives whole-zone semantics for STRICT's zone anchors.

## Do the lists work outside Germany?

Yes — the shipped lists cover **49 country codes** across the 6 regional host families, so every format works in every listed region with no localization step. That is a change from earlier versions, which only carried `de.` (and one `us.`) prefixes.

**How the coverage is built.** LG runs a per-country endpoint matrix: `de.lgeapi.com`, `us.lgeapi.com`, `br.lgeapi.com` and so on all exist. The audit observed the German ones; `scripts/build.py` then cross-products each entry tagged `[REGION-SCOPED]` in `src/` against every code in `src/regions.txt`. One audited host per family therefore yields all-region coverage.

**What that means for evidence.** Generated entries are **DNS-verified, not traffic-observed**: each name resolves to that region's LG infrastructure (checked 2026-09-12), but no capture proves a TV in that region queries it. The audited entries keep their annotations in `src/`, and every built list's header says how many of its entries are generated. Blocking an endpoint your TV never contacts is inert, so the over-inclusion costs you nothing — but it is inference, and the list says so rather than pretending otherwise.

**Why format still matters.** In **adblock** format, STRICT was already region-complete before any of this: its zone anchors (`||lgeapi.com^`, `||nextlgsdp.com^`, ...) and apex entries (`||lgsmartad.com^`, `||lgtvsdp.com^`) match every subdomain. SAFE's adblock list only covers region siblings under the apexes it actually contains — it has no `||nextlgsdp.com^` or `||lgsmartplatform.com^`, since those are STRICT-only zones. The **domains/hosts formats are exact-name** and cannot wildcard subdomains, so they depend entirely on enumeration; they are what the cross-product exists to fill.

**Want a smaller list?** The README's [per-country links](../README.md#per-country-lists) serve one region each — about 61 entries instead of 320. `scripts/build.py build` writes them all; it knows which families exist in which market, so it never emits a name that NXDOMAINs there. For a region **not** in `src/regions.txt`, `python scripts/localize.py --region <cc>` rewrites the built lists onto that code instead.

**If your region is missing,** or you have a query log proving which of these your TV actually contacts, that is exactly the evidence this list wants — see [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md). A code only needs adding to `src/regions.txt` once it is verified to resolve.
